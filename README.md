# Futbol365

## Synopsis

The product will provide season fixtures for a football (soccer) team of interest.
The fixtures will be displayed as local time so that the users can prepare when to watch them.

## Motivation

This is from my experience of following European football season from United States.

- The time zone difference made it difficult to predict when the next match was going to be.
- I had to visit my team's homepage every single time for individual fixtures. 
- Then, search google for appropriate local time (U.S.) of the fixture.

This product is intended to reduce all those hassles.

## Installation

Pull from github repo and run following command

```
npm install
```

## API Reference

The API for fixtures was provided by:
